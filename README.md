Details about this project:

•	Stock price data provided is from 1-Jan-2015 to 31-July-2018 .
•	Six company stocks are part of this data, which are Eicher Motors, Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Infosys and TCS. 
•	Using SQL for all 6 stocks we have imported only two columns: Date and Close price. 
•	We have added 20 Day Moving Average and 50 Day Moving Average to all our six tables.
•	We have created a second table for all the six stocks where we have  inserted the signal i.e. BUY, SELL and HOLD
•	We have created a master table where all the six stock details are stored. 
•	The last step includes creating a user defined function which takes the date as input and returns the signal as output.
